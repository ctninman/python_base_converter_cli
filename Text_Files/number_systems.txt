A number system is defined as a system of writing to express
numbers. It is the mathematical notation for representing
numbers of a given set by using digits or other symbols in a
consistent manner. It provides a unique representation of every
number and represents the arithmetic and algebraic structure of
the figures. It also allows us to operate arithmetic operations
like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

The value of any digit in a number can be determined by:

	The digit
	Its position in the number
	The base of the number system
