The decimal number system has a base of 10 because it uses ten
digits from 0 to 9. In the decimal number system, the positions
successive to the left of the decimal point represent units, tens,
hundreds, thousands and so on. This system is expressed in decimal
numbers. Every position shows a particular power of the base (10).

Example of Decimal Number System:

The decimal number 1,457 consists of the digit 7 in the units
position, 5 in the tens place, 4 in the hundreds position, and
1 in the thousands place whose value can be written as:

(1 x 10**3) + (4 x 10**2) + (5 x 10**1) + (7 x 10**1)

(1 x 1000) + (4 x 100) + (5 x 10) + (7 x 1)

1000 + 400 + 50 + 7
