Decimal to Other Base System

Steps

Step 1 − Divide the decimal number to be converted by the value
of the new base.

Step 2 − Get the remainder from Step 1 as the rightmost digit
(least significant digit) of new base number.

Step 3 − Divide the quotient of the previous divide by the new base.

Step 4 − Record the remainder from Step 3 as the next digit (to the
left) of the new base number.

Repeat Steps 3 and 4, getting remainders from right to left, until
the quotient becomes zero in Step 3.

The last remainder thus obtained will be the Most Significant Digit
(MSD) of the new base number.
