Other Base System to Decimal System

Steps

Step 1 − Determine the column (positional) value of each digit
(this depends on the position of the digit and the base of the
number system).

Step 2 − Multiply the obtained column values (in Step 1) by the
digits in the corresponding columns.

Step 3 − Sum the products calculated in Step 2. The total is the
equivalent value in decimal.
